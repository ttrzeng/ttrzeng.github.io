				<h1>The momentum of failure and success</h1>

			<p>
				One of my good friend is a smooth talker with the ladies. Every time I hang out with him in public, he would not hesistate to talk to any girl that he finds attractive. The way he talks to the girls are very playful and fun. Most of the time, he
				would end up getting the girl's phone number. But from time to time, he bombs. He would still have times where the girl is not interested and ignores him. However, he never loses his momentum or get discouraged. When ever he gets rejected, he simply moves on to the next cute girl that passes by. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Baffled, I asked him how does he never seem to be afraid of rejection. At first, I thought it was because of his 'I don't care' personality or his natural immunity to rejection. But he explained 'No one is ever fully immune to rejection. Rejection will always hurt but if you don't give it time to sink in, it will feel like a small pinch from a needle'
			</p>

			<p>
				A failure would hurt a lot if you were only getting rejected once a month or every once in a while. There would be a window of few days for you to carry around that failure. You would sit with it for all those days and it be would be really heavy because you give it time to sink in and let your mind dwell on it. But my friend however, didn't give the time for it to sink in. If he gets rejected from one girl, he would only have to carry it until the next girl he talks to (usually around 10 mins). It doesn't have time to define him when he start initiating again so quickly.
			</p>

			<p>
				My friend learned that if he can shorten his starting cycle, failures don't have the time to define him. At the end of the day, rejection from the first few girls doesn't hold a whole lot of weight when he gets a girl's number later on in the day.
				He starts so often that the shadow of one failure looks tiny in the light of all the new opportunities for success.  
			</p>

			<p>
				Interestingly, this same principle also applies with success. If you don't start again, if you don't share what you've learned with others and keep applying the knowledge that you have obtained to create something new, yesterday's successes will start to define your today and tomorrow. Instead of just celebrating them, which you should do, you'll start to protect them and you'll be afraid to start over from fear of losing your successful identity.
			</p>

			<p>
				This phenomenon happens more often than you think. For instance, the 'one hit wonders' in the music industry. The true tragedy of a 'one hit wonder' isn't that someone releases one big song and then never has another song that is as popular. They're still making music and they're still sharing their gifts even though they might not be making as much as before but the real tragedy is when someone succeeds once and then never tries again. 
			</p>

			<p>
				No matter how many failures or successes you have in your life, never stop the momentum. You will be surprised how far you can go.
