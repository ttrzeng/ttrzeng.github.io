				<h1>Motivation vs Discipline</h1>
				<span class="post-date">January 16 2017</span>

					As famous youtuber/philosopher Ellio Hulse once said <i>"Motivation doesn't get you the thing you want. It's just a feeling that makes you feel excited to work towards your goal. Discipline however is the machine that keeps you moving. No matter how bad the situation is, if you can <b>commit</b> to do one thing everyday and put it into an habit, you will slowly move foward and progress without even have to think about it"</i>

					In life, whenever we want to improve ourselves whether it's working on a project, studying for school or improving in sports, consistency is the key to reach our goals. But unfortunately, that's also one of the hardest task to accompolish, especially when we have so many distractions that we tend to get side tracked on our goals or dreams.

					During dragon boat physical training, we did an exercise where we do 10 sets of push ups. In each set, we would try and do as many push ups as we can. However, the catch is that our lowest amount of reps among the 10 sets would be our score. For instance, if Steve did 20 push ups in the first set but only 3 in the last set, his final score would be 3; compare to the people who did consistently 5 push ups in each set, Steve would have a lower score than everyone else even though in total he did more push ups than everyone else; I used to be just like Steve.

					Ever since I was little, I loved eating I wasn't a picky eater, thus I would eat anything that is convenient; I was a chubby kid ever since I was in grade 4 and being made fun of in school was never a fun time for me.

					In grade 8, I started to exercise more by running 5km, 800m sprints and playing more sports especially after watching one of those motivational videos on Youtube. I always thought that if I just watch motivational videos, I would hype myself up to accompolish my goals. But unfortunately, just like Steve, I would always work really hard for a week, then go back to being lazy the week after since I was really burnt out physically.

					Then one day, I thought to myself: "Maybe doing these workouts are too unrealistic and difficult to maintain. Let's try something simple but keep it consistency". From then on, I told myself that no matter how tired or whatever excuse that I might have, I would do 30 push ups and 50 sit ups everyday. The key was to give myself a routine that was hard but not so hard that it would stop me from doing them everyday. Surprisingly, after a few months of consistent workout, I have moved from doing 30 push ups to 60 push ups and from 50 sit ups to 200 sit ups. Not only did I grew stronger but this workout has been embedded in my daily life even till this day.

					A famous chinese idiom once said <i>"A thousand mile always starts with one step"</i>. Working on a goal is never hard if you can break it down to small goals. The hardest part of reaching a goal is to <b>start</b>, be <b>patient</b> and discipline yourself to be consistent so that you will take a small step everyday.
