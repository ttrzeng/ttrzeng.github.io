				<h1>Learning how to learn</h1>

				Through out my university years, I have struggled many sleepless nights trying to understand complex math and physics only to forget them after final exams. I have always thought that school was waste of time because almost 70% of the things that I have learned are forgotten if I wasn't constantly using them. It wasn't until third year of university where I realized that although school teaches many subjects from economics to quantum physics, the most important lesson the school is teaching is not learning these subjects, but is to teach students to learn how to learn by training your brain to be constantly thinking/moving.

				For instance, when you are playing a rubic's cube, solving the cube is not going to be useful in anyway in real life, however, it keeps your brain thinking and keeps it moving. Like a muscle, the more you use your brain, the more your brain becomes more efficient.

				In real life, calculus, complex algebra or quantum physics are not going to be very useful unless you go into a specialized field or research. However, putting yourself in an environment where your brain is constantly working on complex problems can help you think more efficiently when it comes to dealing with real world problems.
