				<h1>Core components to self improvement</h1>
				<span class="post-date">September 26, 2017</span>

				<br>
				<br>
				<b>The 4 core components of self improvement</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Physical Conditioning - Total body fitness, weight, muscle mass, endurance, health.</li>
					<li>Mental health -  Alertness and awareness, productivity </li>
					<li>Psychological health - Stress control, be in control, worry free.</li>
					<li>Emotional state - How do you feel? what makes you happy?</li>
				</ol>
				<br>

				<b>Physical Daily Improvements</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Eat out less, learn to cook more healthy recipes. Stay away from food with high sodium and high sugar. Have a balance between carbs, meat and veggies. Prepare meals before hand so you have something to eat whenever you are hungry.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Exercise 5 times a week if possible. Be careful not to injure yourself. If you are sore, do an easy workout. The point is to do it even if you are tired; an easy workout is better than no workout. Remember that working out is a marathon, not a sprint. The main purpose is to be consistent and discipline oneself to do something even if the body and mind is at its low point.</li>
					<br>
					<li>If a workout routine no longer makes you sore, it either means your workout is not intense enough or you simply plateaued. Create new exercise routines that work on muscles that you don't usually use. Change it up so that the body will never get used to exercises. Note that if you are not nervous before going to the gym, it means your workout routine is not hard enough.</li>
				</ol>

				<b>Personal Physical Challenges (Do 1 of the 4)</b>
				<ol>
					<li>One arm pull up</li>
					<li>Flares</li>
					<li>Planche push up</li>
					<li>One arm push up: 10 each hand</li>
				</ol>
				<br>

				<b>Mental Daily Improvements</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Just because you finished university, it doesn't mean you don't need to study. Pick up a book and start reading. Commit to 30 minutes a day on reading.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Be organized and have a plan for the day before hand. Write a list of things to do before going to bed every night</li>
					<br>
					<li>Stay focused while working. Start by working in 30 minute intervals and gradually increase it to an hour. This helps train your mental toughness and mental muscle growth.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Do something uncomfortable everyday (ex. talk to that random person in the coffee shop).</li>
				</ol>

				<b>Personal Mental Challenges</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Take online courses and join groups that share the same interests as you. Share your knowledge and utilize other's skills to expand your knowledge.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Meditate 10 - 15 minutes every morning. Clear your mind before tackling the day. Even if your life is a mess, learn to live in the eye of the tornado and observe the chaos in your life with a clear mind.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Don't get too comfortable working at your job. If you are not learning something new everyday at work, take a fast pace part time job at a startup to keep your skills updated with the latest technology.</li>
				</ol>

				<b>Psychological Daily Improvements</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Be in control and always monitor your daily stress level. Don't overthink about things that might happen. If there is a roof on your head, food on the table and family to be there for you, you are going to be ok.</li>
					<br>
					<li>No one owes you anything. Don't always have expectations when it comes to meeting people. Be casual and see where that takes you.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Don't stress over the little things. Do your best and let the situation take care of itself. You might not do everything perfect everytime, but you will at least learn from it. Just be brutally honest with yourself and give your very best.</li>
				</ol>

				<b>Emotional State Daily Improvements</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Be self-aware of your emotions. Understand why you feel a certain way. You don’t have control over others but you ALWAYS have a choice of how you react to a situation.</li><br>
					<li>Spend quality time with friends and family. Loneliness will effect your mental efficiency for productivity.</li><br>
					<li>Before making a decision, be sure to be in a calm state. Don't let your emotions take over your rational thinking.</li><br>
					<li>Don’t be afraid of losing people but be afraid of losing yourself trying not to lose someone else.</li>
				</ol>

				<b>Always keep these questions in mind:</b>
				<p>
					Where are you? Where do you want to go? Are the things you are going to do help you become the person you want to be? And most importantly, who are you?
				</p>

				<b>Things to keep in mind</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Don’t be lazy, you have only 24 hours in a day. Make the best of it. Don’t waste it on people that doesn’t care about you.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Quality over quantity.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Be honest with yourself and others, live with integrity.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Change takes time and time is all it takes. Be patient.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Find little things to appreciate everyday, even if it’s the ability to wake up to live another day. </li>
					<br>
					<li>Listen more and let your action do the talking.</li>
