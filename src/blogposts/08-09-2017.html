				<h1>Gonna science the shit out of myself</h1>
				<span class="post-date">August 9 2017</span>

				<p>
					Recently, I have started tracking my own finances and spendings. After a few months of collecting the data, I have found something really interesting that I have never noticed. For the month of June, I have spent over $500 eating out at restaurants and $50 on groceries. Comparing to the month of July, I have only spent $150 on grocery and $50 eating out. That's a $300 difference! If I haven't been tracking my spendings, I would have never noticed how much money I have been spending every month; if I had a conscious idea of what I have done, I would have been more responsible with my spendings. Although it seems that tracking our daily spendings is a trivial task but not many actually try and understand where money comes from and where it goes (unless you are an accountant).

					After noticing these unconscious spendings, I started to question what other bad habits that I might have missed by not collecting data and analyzing on them. Come to think of it, improving oneself can be broken down like a science experiment. We would first need a controlled environment, data, theory and most importantly analysis (it's like going back to school all over again).

				<p>
					First, there are a few categories that I believe is important to analyze in order to become a stronger version of myself; these categories can be broken down to subcategories for more specific analysis. 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>1. Health: Calorie and nutrition</li>
					<li>2. Time Management</li>
					<li>3. Sleep Quality</li>
					<li>4. Energy Management</li>
				</ul>
				
				<b>Health</b>
				<p>
					You know the nutrition label at the back of all the food that we eat? Those are important information that we can extract in order to measure what goes into our bodies. However, since everyone's body react to different food differently, we must have a controlled environment. First, record what we eat on a daily basis. Keep a consistent diet for a short period of time to see how it affects our body and our energy levels. Then remove one or two of the food that we think it's 'bad' in our daily diet and replace it with different types of food to see how it affects our body. This might take a while before we can find the most optimal diet that can optimize our body and mental efficiency (that's why it's called experiements). A good example of finding this 'optimal' diet is my friend Sam. He eats the same food everyday; tuna sandwiches and lots of vegetables as snacks. Although he never drinks coffee, I have never seen him tired even after long hours studying physics. It turns out that because of his consistency of eating the same food everyday, his body became super efficient at metabolising the food. Compounding this with regular exercise, Sam is both physically and mentally strong.
