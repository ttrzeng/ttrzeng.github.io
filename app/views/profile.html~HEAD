		           My name is <i>Talent Zeng</i>. I'm a Mathematical Physics major from University of Waterloo. During my spare time, I program and develop websites as a hobby. In the future, my goal is to become a skilled full stack developer and build useful applications for myself and others.

		        	This blog is intended to be a place for me to write down things I’m interested in, quotes that inspired me, random thoughts, philsophies and things I have learned from daily encounters. Most often, the purpose of this blog is for me and my future self to read. The posts & topics will be and can be anything that I find interesting or ideas and thoughts that I want to share.
