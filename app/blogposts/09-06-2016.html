				<h1>Dealing with difficult concepts and logic</h1>

				When it comes to difficult logic problems, I have noticed that in order to execute the solution to the problem most efficiently, it's important utilize 3 methods:
			</p>

			<b>1) Build a structure</b>
			<p>This is the draft. The blue print of the whole problem. It let's you see the problem as a whole and what needs to be solved. Simply put, it's almost impossible to eat an elephant in one sitting. We must divide the issue into smaller bits of easy tasks. Modulize and break down the problem into small components so that you won't be lost and confused about what is the small errors that are causing the problem.</p>

			<p>Once a structure or blueprint is established, all you need to do is to focus on all your energy on solving the little problems that makes up the big problem. Just like building a house. Once you built your frame of the house, the only thing left to do is to insert the bricks.</p>

			<b>2) If a problem can't be solved, target its surroundings</b>

			<p>A good friend of mine once told me: 'If you don't know something, no matter how much you try, you will never get it'. At first, I was confused about his statement, 'Can't you just figure it out eventually by learning?'. But once you think about it more, it makes sense. You simply can't figure something out if you don't understand the solution or the idea. It's the reason why you are so stressed out to solve the problem to begin with. You simply don't understand how everything are connected.</p>

			<p>	So you hit a brick wall, the problem is more difficult than expected. Under stress, it's very common that we panic and do what the first thing that pop into our heads. Because of this, a lot of people bash, hit and keep hitting the wall until they give up or burnt out. A good solution in situations like this is to observe the wall and figure out what information you can gather about the wall; it could be the way it's built or the material it is made out of. </p>

			<p>In order to solve a unknown problem, you must first look around and use the knowledge that you already know start from there in order to understand how these information are linked. The answer would simply would reveal itself and becomes more clear. If you imagine you are shooting an invisible target from a given range, it's would be almost impossible to hit it. However, if I drew a few visible red dots around the target, it would be much easier to score. Sure, you might not be able to fully see the target but sometimes, you don't need to know where the whole target, you just need a few hints to understand the general idea of where the target is. </p>

			<b>3) If there are 10 questions you need to learn to solve a problem, study the ones you are good at first then expand from there</b>

			<p>Often times, we get frustrated and overwhelmed with the difficult questions we don't understand. Under stress, we tend to spend our time banging our heads on those questions until the point we get so stressed and worried that we start to forget how to solve the questions we already know answers to.</p>

			<p>The trick is not to stress over difficult problems but to first work on solving questions that we are easy to us. It builds confidence and makes you more motivated to learn. Furthermore, not only it builds a solid foundation that you can stand on if you can't solve harder problems but also set yourself in a position where you can apply a method often from starcraft called "turtling" where you expand to resources and learn base off your foundation. Simply put, you are giving yourself a 'check point' to fall back on if things go wrong.</p>
