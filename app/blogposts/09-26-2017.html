				<h1>Core components of self improvement</h1>
				<span class="post-date">September 26, 2017</span>

				<br>
				<br>
				<b>The 4 core components of self improvement</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Physical Conditioning - Total body fitness, weight, muscle mass, endurance, health</li>
					<li>Mental health -  Alertness and awareness, productivity </li>
					<li>Psychological health - Stress control, be in control, worry free</li>
					<li>Emotional state - How do you feel? what makes you happy?</li>
				</ol>
				<br>

				<b>Physical Daily Improvements</b>
				<ol>
					<li>1. Eat out less, learn to cook more healthy recipes. Stay away from food with high sodium and high sugar. Have a balance between carbs, meat and veggies. Prepare meals before hand so you have something to eat whenever you are hungry.</li>
					<br>
					<li>2. Exercise 5 times a week if possible. Be careful not to injure yourself. If you are sore, do an easy workout. The point is to do it even if you are tired; an easy workout is better than no workout. Remember that working out is a marathon, not a sprint. The main purpose is to be consistent and discipline oneself to do something even if the body and mind is at it's low point.</li>
					<br>
					<li>3. If a workout routine no longer makes you sore, it either means your workout is not intense enough or you simply plateaued. Create new exercise routines that work on muscles that you usually don't use. Change it up so that the body will never get used to exercises.</li>
				</ol>

				<b>Personal physical challenges (Do 1 of the 3)</b>
				<ol>
					<li>One arm pull up</li>
					<li>Flares</li>
					<li>Planche push up</li>
					<li>One arm push up: 10 each hand</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
