				<h1>Gonna science the shit out of myself</h1>
				<span class="post-date">August 9 2017</span>

				<p>
					Recently, I have started tracking my own finances and spendings. After a few months of collecting the data, I have found something really interesting that I have never noticed. For the month of June, I have spent over $500 eating out at restaurants and $50 on groceries. Comparing to the month of July, I have only spent $150 on grocery and $50 eating out. That's a $300 difference! If I haven't been tracking my spendings, I would have never noticed how much money I have been spending every month; if I had a conscious idea of what I have done, I would have been more responsible with my spendings.
				</p>

				<p>
					After noticing these unconscious spendings, I started to question what other bad habits that I might have missed by not collecting data and analyzing on them. Come to think of it, improving oneself can be broken down like a science experiment. We would first need a controlled environment, data, theory and most importantly analysis (it's like going back to school all over again). 
				</p>

				<p>
					First, there are a few categories that I believe is important to analyze in order to become a stronger version of myself; these categories can be broken down to subcategories for more specific analysis.

				<br>
				<span>3. Sleep Quality</span>
				<br>
				<span>4. Energy Management</span>

				<b>Health</b>
				<p>
					You know the nutrition label at the back of all the food that we eat? Those are important information that we can extract in order to measure what goes into our bodies. However, since everyone's body react to different food differently, we must first start with a controlled environment. First, record what we eat on a daily basis. Keep a consistent diet for a short period of time to see how it affects our body and our energy levels. Then remove one or two of the food that we think it's 'bad' in our daily diet and replace it with different types of food to see how it affects our body. Be patient beause this might take a while before we can find the most optimal diet that can optimize our body and mental efficiency (that's why it's called experiements). A good example of finding this 'optimal' diet is my friend Sam. He eats the same food everyday; tuna sandwiches and lots of vegetables as snacks. Although he never drinks coffee, I have never seen him tired even after long hours studying physics. It turns out that because of his consistency of eating the same food everyday, his body became super efficient at metabolising the food. Compounding this with regular exercise, Sam is both physically and mentally strong.

				<b>Time Management</b>
				<p>
					In a Ted talk by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piSLobJfZ3c">Scott Young</a>, he has discovered that people actually has more time than they think even if they have a 60 hour work week. In his talk, he used something called the time logs where he records the duration of everything he does everyday; which includes doing the dishes, walking the dog, brushing his teeth etc. Surprisingly, for someone that spends 60 hours working at their job, most of the time is actually spent on commuting, meetings and talking to colleagues rather than efficiently sitting down and work. With this discovery it helped him realize that a person actually have lots of free time; they just unconsciously used it on in daily interactions with their environments. If a person have good time management and prioritize their tasks, he/she can minize the time used in between and use it where they think is more valuable (So if next time a girl often says she doesn't have time for you to go on a date, I'm sorry but it just means you aren't that much of a priority to her).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					For me, rather than writing down a time log for everything that I do, I set myself in an exam environment by giving a time limit on the tasks that I do. For instance, if I'm going to write new module to optimize my website, I will limit myself an hour to do the job. If I can't complete the task within that hour, I force myself to move on and do something else. This way I will be able to fully cherish my time and focus on the task within that hour.
				</p>

				<b>Sleep Quality</b>
				<p>
					Base on my experiences with sleep, I have noticed that sleeping in certain time and waking up at a certain time really helps with my clarity and mental focus through out the day. Back in university, I used to sleep late and wake up late. Although I still get my 8 hours of sleep, the quality of my sleep was not optimal since during the time my body told me to sleep, I forced myself to stay awake; this messes with my body's internal clock. The key here is to keep sleep consistent and minimize flutuation between the time going to bed and waking up. When you force yourself to sleep at a certain time consistently, your body will prepare itself so that when that time comes, you will naturally feel sleepy. This also goes the same for waking up. However, this works differently for everybody since we all have different internal clocks. Do whatever works for you but keep it consistent. Most importantly, record your mental state after each period of time of sleep; not only you can figure out when is the best time for you to sleep but it might be a good way to experiment with the duration of sleep. You might even discover that you can be alert all day with only 4 hours of sleep if you sleep around 9PM at night. 
				</p>

				<b>Energy Management</b>
				<p>
					This one is going to be hard to measure. The only thing that I can really say about this is to listen to your body. When you have been working on a task for a long period of time, if your body is starting to feel a bit tired, take a 10 minute break. By break, I mean completely doing something that is relaxing and doesn't relate to the task that you were doing. In addition, it's also a good idea to measure your state of energy throughout the day so you know at what time during the day your energy level is at its peak (do the most difficult task during this time).
