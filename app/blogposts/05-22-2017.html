				<h1>Thoughts after graduation</h1>
				<span class="post-date">May 22, 2017</span>
				<p>
					Well, after 5 years of sleepless nights and solving mathematical problems equations after equations, I have finally finished my degree in mathematical physics. Although it was a long time, I feel like my life has just begun. Now the biggest question is, what now? Besides the fact that I got a job that I love, how am I going to spend the rest of the 20s? Should I specialize and get good at one skill or should I try a little of everything to see what other things I'm gifted at and love? What about my philosophies towards relationships, life purpose and personal beliefs?
				</p>
				<p>
					Personally, I believe that 20s is the period of time when a person is the most energized; which is why it's the perfect time to build a good foundation as a person for the many years later in life. I really want to look back in 10 years to see how much I have grown and how much I have changed during these golden years. Although right now I still haven't figured out everything that I want in life, I have some thoughts that I should address so I can see the changes as I grow older.
				</p>
				<p>
					In our 20s, most people have just graduated and are looking for ways to make money but neglect the fact that they should give themselves time to have a better understanding of themselves. The average person works roughly around 40 years during their life time; there will be plenty of time and opportunities to work and make money. It is crucial that I know <b>why I do the things I do</b>, <b>who am I</b> and <b>what I am good at</b>. Thus, instead of specializing and focusing in one particular goal, I'm going to run a series of experiments just like I did in science labs by going out and trying out different things. It can be salsa dancing, rock climbing, investing or whatever I can find. The goal in these experiments are not succeed but to get experience and information that will help me answer these 3 questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether it's getting a job or doing a new activity, always keep in mind that it's not necessarily about how much money can I can make, how successful I am or how big of reputation that I have but what can this job/activity teach me about my values, weaknesses, strengths, core beliefs, what matters to me most in life, what can it teach me in terms of skills, what are my capabilities and what are my potentials. As long as I keep doing this to everything I do and use these metrics to make me answer my 3 questions, no matter how badly I screwed up or failed, in the end I can find inner success. 
				</p>

				<p>
					These thoughts are just the tip of the iceberg. I will be updating my progress as I figure out my inner core values.
