				<h1>Dear 2017 self...</h1>
				<span class="post-date">January 1, 2018</span>

				<p>
					I know, 2017 was a really tough year on you. I'm very sorry that one of your best friend took his own life, you and your co-founder of your startup broke up and your parents are getting a divorce all at the beginning of the year. Although, you stayed strong because you needed to finish your last semester of school, deep down I know you are just numbing your emotions so you don't have to think about the bitter sweet time you spent building a company with your co-founder/friend, the last time you played mini golf with your best friend during a wonderful Christmas evening and the time where your family is having a happy dinner together.
				</p>

				<p>
					Staying positive, you hammered through the last 4 months of 12 hour study sessions while applying to many full-time front end developer positions. It was tough trying to prepare for technical job interviews, handling job rejections while trying to understand research papers about quantum computing. But at the end of the day, all your hard work helped you finish school and landed yourself a job at a startup in downtown Toronto; things started to get better. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Sure, biking 30 minutes to downtown Toronto everyday seems to be a bit annoying but after working in the startup for a few months, you realized that you are really passionate with the work you are doing and enjoyed learning so much from the people you are working with. Thinking you are going to be in Toronto for the long run, you decided to move closer to work and signed a year lease in an apartment close to downtown. After settling yourself down, from time to time, you go home to visit your mum and your sister to make sure they are doing ok. Although it wasn't perfect, getting yourself out of the mess was something to appreciate; you started to feel the numbness in your heart fading.  
				</p>

				<p>
					This was the happily ever after story that I want you to end up with but the another storm has yet to come. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Just 3 weeks after you moved in to your new apartment, the CTO of the company called you in one morning and said you are going to be let go. You sat at that office chair and the numbness feeling that you have forgotten came right back in. You didn't know what to do. The thoughts of rent, the money that you need to pay off your loans and what are you going to do next all came rushing through your brain. Most importantly, it was certainly a huge blow to your self-esteem and self-worth. After you packed your things and carried your things back to your apartment, instead of feeling sorry for yourself, you sat on that computer and started to apply to over 30 jobs. Although the numbness was still there, you carry on to do what needs to be done to put yourself back in the right path. 
				</p>

				<p>
					However, after weeks of no job offers, dealing with your parent's divorce while the monthly bill is coming in, the numbness disappeared and in comes the rush of emotions. You sat on that chair and broke down; you never felt so alone and helpless in your life. You started to wonder if this is the pain how your friend felt when he took his own life. As you have darker and darker thoughts, you started to consider the dark path your friend has taken. But then, as you thought about the people you cared about and your self-fish act you are about to commit, you knew that it was never the right choice, especially the fact that your family needs you more than ever; as long as you are still alive, no matter how bad the situation is, it's only temporary.
				</p>

				<p>
					Pitying yourself will never bring you happiness. You realized that it's not about what is happening to you but what are you going to do about it and how you are going to deal with it that defines you. After a long reflection of yourself that night, instead of weeping for your misery, you picked up freelancing work to pay the rent and went home more often to take care of your family. As long as there is a will, there is always a way to fix any bad situation. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Eventually, something came up... you got multiple job offers from Waterloo; a place where rent is a lot cheaper but a higher pay than your previous job. Excited, you went on vacation with your family for a few weeks before buckling yourself down at your next job.
				</p>

				<p>
					I know this year's journey was really painful to endure but ultimately, I'm proud of you. You are the reason why I'm still here, wiser and more mature than before. I'm have grown so much mental and emotional toughness during these misfortunes. No matter what the future holds, I will always remember the lesson that you have taught me.
