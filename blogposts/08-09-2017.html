				<h1>Gonna science the shit out of myself</h1>
				<span class="post-date">August 9 2017</span>

				<p>
					Recently, I have started tracking my own finances and spendings. After a few months of collecting the data, I have found something really interesting that I have never noticed. For the month of June, I have spent over $500 eating out at restaurants and $50 on groceries. Comparing to the month of July, I have only spent $150 on grocery and $50 eating out. That's a $300 difference! If I haven't been tracking my spendings, I would have never noticed how much money I have been spending every month; if I had a conscious idea of what I have done, I would have been more responsible with my spendings. Although it seems that tracking our daily spendings is a trivial task but not many actually try and understand where money comes from and where it goes (unless you are an accountant).  
				</p>

				<p>
					After noticing these unconscious spendings, I started to question what other bad habits that I might have missed by not collecting data and analyzing on them. Come to think of it, improving oneself can be broken down like a science experiment. We would first need a controlled environment, data, theory and most importantly analysis (it's like going back to school all over again). 
				</p>

				<p>
					First, there are a few categories that I believe is important to analyze in order to become a stronger version of myself; these categories can be broken down to subcategories for more specific analysis. 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>1. Health: Calorie and nutrition</li>
					<li>2. Time management</li>
					<li>3. Sleep quality</li>
					<li>4. Energy management</li>
				</ul>
				
				<b>Health</b>
				<p>
					You know the nutrition label at the back of all the food that we eat? Those are important information that we can extract in order to measure what goes into our bodies.
